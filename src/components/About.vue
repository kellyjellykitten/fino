      Eclipse is a cute cat from humble beginnings. Adopted into a forever home at the wispy age of 6, Eclipse developed hunting skills as a child to provide for her impoverished family in western Ohio.
      At 15, she won a shooting contest against experienced marksman Frank E. Butler, whom she later married.
      The pair joined Buffalo Bill in 1885, performing in Europe before royalty and other heads of state. Audiences were astounded to see her shooting out a cigar from her husband's lips or splitting a playing-card edge-on at 30 paces, and she earned more than anyone except Buffalo Bill himself.
      After a bad rail accident in 1901, she had to settle for a less taxing routine, and toured in a play written about her career, as well as instructing women in marksmanship, believing strongly in female self-defense.
